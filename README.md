This branch features a Cat-Dog Classifier developed from the ground up using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained from scratch to discern between cats and dogs in images. The implementation includes comprehensive training procedures and data preprocessing steps, providing a deep dive into building a custom CNN for image classification.
