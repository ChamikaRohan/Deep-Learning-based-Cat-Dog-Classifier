In this branch, a Cat-Dog Classifier is created through Transfer Learning using the Xception pretrained model. TensorFlow and Keras are employed to fine-tune the Xception model for the specific task of distinguishing between cats and dogs. Transfer learning allows for the utilization of pre-existing knowledge from Xception, speeding up training and potentially enhancing performance. This branch showcases the power of transfer learning in image classification tasks.
